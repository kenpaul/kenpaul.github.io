      <description>OBJECTIVE To compete and maintain relevance in todays business climate IT needs to simplify and accelerate the delivery of infrastructure platforms. The way that we procure, assemble, and manage these systems therefore directly affects that goal. Modern compute, storage, and network platforms continue to advance in performance and capability and consequently increase in complexity. The ability to obtain, train, and retain staff resources to efficiently integrate and maintain this composite IT structure is becoming harder to sustain.</description>

      <description>Documentation as Code (Docs as Code) refers to a philosophy that you should be writing documentation with the same tools as code:
Issue Trackers Version Control (Git) Plain Text Markup (Markdown, reStructuredText, Asciidoc) Code Reviews Automated Tests This means following the same workflows as development teams, and being integrated in the product team. It enables a culture where writers and developers both feel ownership of documentation, and work together to make it as good as possible.</description>
